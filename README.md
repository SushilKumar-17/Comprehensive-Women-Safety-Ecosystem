# Women Safety Analytics

**Women Safety Analytics** is a comprehensive smart surveillance and alerting framework designed to enhance the safety of women through artificial intelligence and connected technology. This ecosystem comprises three core components: an AI-powered CCTV system, a mobile safety application, and a biometric-enabled wearable (watch) system. Each part is tailored to detect threats, send alerts, and support proactive safety interventions in real time.

Developed as a major academic project, this solution leverages cutting-edge technologies to address the rising safety concerns faced by women in urban and semi-urban environments. The system operates autonomously to analyze surroundings, detect risk scenarios, and trigger timely responses.

</div>

### 1. AI-Powered CCTV System

- **Person Detection with Gender Classification**  
  Utilizes deep learning to detect individuals in camera feeds and classify their gender.

- **Threat Scenario Identification**  
  Detects conditions such as: a lone woman at night, or a woman surrounded by multiple men in isolated areas.

- **Automated Alerts**  
  Sends automatic alerts to the app or watch system when potential threats are detected in live video feeds.

---

### 2. Mobile Safety Application

- **SOS Trigger via Shake Gesture**  
  Sends an instant SOS message to emergency contacts and nearby community members upon detecting rapid phone shakes.

- **Community Alert Network**  
  A proximity-based forum that notifies users nearby when someone is in danger, promoting real-time community-based support.

- **Crowdsourced Crime Reporting**  
  Allows users to report incidents, contributing to a community-driven safety database.

- **Heatmap Generation**  
  Visual representation of high-risk zones based on historic reports and alerts, helping users avoid unsafe areas.

### 3. Biometric Watch System

- **Biometric Monitoring**  
  Continuously monitors biometric indicators like heart rate for unusual spikes linked to distress.

- **Automated Emergency Alerts**  
  Triggers emergency alerts if abnormal biometric patterns are detected, without requiring manual input.

- **Seamless Sync**  
  Syncs with the mobile app for location tracking and incident logging.
